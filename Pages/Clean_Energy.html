				 <p>This game was created as part of my masters course.</a></p>
				 <p>
					In this module we were challenged to create a game based on one of the UN sustainable development goals. My team decided to tackle clean energy.
					In this game the player is challenged to power a town based on a real world location using only clean, sustainable power sources.
					The game features a map based on Sprakenbull in Germany and Vik in Iceland.
					The player can build many sustainable sources but also unsustainable ones. We want the player to understand why sometimes unsustainable ones are needed but how we can move away from them.
				</p>
					For this project I was the main progammer and focused on systems design and development. I created a tool for the team to use that allowed them to create maps in the Unity Editor.
					This tool would generate a level based on parameters the designer set. The designer could then edit this map to bring it closer to the real world.
