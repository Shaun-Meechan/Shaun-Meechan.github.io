				 <p>This game was created as part of my 3rd year module Professional Project, <a href="https://www.abertay.ac.uk/course-search/undergraduate/computer-game-applications-development/"> DES310.</a></p>
				 <p>
				 	In this module we are tasked with creating a multi-displinary team and making a game for a real client. For this project our client was CHAS. They wanted a game that discussed what it is like living with a sibling with a life-shortening condition. 
					As we had no creative guidelines other than to spread their message we decided to make a platformer game in the same vein as Celeste. After the module the project received funding to fix outstanding bugs and optimise for lower end platforms. The project
					has since been published by CHAS and will be used in high schools throughout Scotland to replace their existing program for educating students about what CHAS does.
